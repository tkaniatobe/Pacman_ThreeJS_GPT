# Pacman ThreeJS/ChatGPT Prototype

This Pacman game is an experimental project that showcases the capabilities of using ChatGPT to generate a Pacman game using the ThreeJS library. It demonstrates how natural language processing and AI can be used to create interactive game experiences.

## About

The Pacman game is developed using ThreeJS, a JavaScript 3D library, which provides the necessary tools to render and animate a 3D game environment in a web browser. The game features a Pacman character that navigates through a maze, collects points, and avoids ghosts. The game also includes interactive features such as keyboard controls and game over functionality.

## Features

- Rendered using ThreeJS for 3D graphics and animation.
- Maze generation algorithm to create the game level.
- Keyboard controls to move the Pacman character.
- Ghosts that follow Pacman and can collide with him.
- Game over functionality with a "New Game" button to restart the game.
- FPS (frames per second) tracker to monitor the game's performance.

## Usage

To run the Pacman game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
